#Example R script to run the TCSAM02 assessment model in MSE mode.
#  (NOTE:this requires the rTCSAM02 and related R packages be installed)
#To run:
#  1. Copy this file and the folders "InputFiles.2018AM17","InputFiles.OpModMode", and "InputFiles.EstModMode"
#      to a folder outside the tcsam02 project (so the runs will NOT be part of the project's git version control).
#  2. Open the copied version of this file in RStudio and change the working directory to be the same as that file.
#  3. Modify the "path2tcsam02" variable below so it agrees with the path to the tcsam02 program
#  4. "Source" this file
#The output will be 5 runs of 10 years each of the operating model and estimation model in folders under "testMSE"
#in the working directory this file was "sourced" in.
require(rTCSAM02);
