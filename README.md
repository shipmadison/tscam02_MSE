# tcsam02
TCSAM02 is the current (Septemtber 2017) modeling framework for the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Tanner crab assessment. It supersedes the
TCSAM2013 mdeling framework, which was used for the Tanner crab assessment from 
September 2014 to May, 2017. The two modeling frameworks were demonstrated to
produce identical ("exactly equivalent") results at the May 2017 Crab Plan Team (CPT)
meeting in Juneau. The TCSAM02 framework was subsequently recommended by the CPT, and 
approved by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council's Science and Statistical Committee,
for use in the September 2017 Tnaner crab assessment.
